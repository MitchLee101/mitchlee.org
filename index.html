      <div class="line-break"></div>
      <p>
        I create and execute marketing strategies that help businesses grow. What's my secret weapon?
				A problem/policy/action approach to creating marketing strategies and a playbook of 150+ tactics tested over 5+ years throughout my SEO and marketing career.
				I have worked with Tulsa Community College, US NEWS University Connection, Bisk Education and managed marketing for a handful of regional and national eCommerce businesses.
				With these employers and clients, I work in viability testing, STP, competitive analysis, and 4Ps to execution.
				What are the results? These businesses have grown up to 80% in web traffic and up to 50% in acquired leads.
			<p>
				Want to know more about the strategies and tactics I used to hit these numbers?

	<h2>Tactics? Not the whole 150+, but here's 15 public tactics that will increase ROI</h2>
</div>
<div class="spaceR">
<div class="carousel"
  data-flickity='{ "autoPlay": 1200, "wrapAround": true }'>
	<div class="carousel-cell">
		<div class="caraH">
			<h2>Keyword + Year</h2>
			<div class="line-break"></div>
			<p> Commonly seen with review or "best" search queries, users occasionally search for terms mentioning specific years.
					The user may be researching product versions for current or previous years or looking to compare models.
					Regardless, data aggregators and Google show that many "keyword + year" queries have significant search volume.
					<p>
					To capitalize on these queries, content could be produced to optimize for users and search engines.
			</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="carousel-cell">
		<div class="caraH">
			<h2>Mega Resource Pages</h2>
			<div class="line-break"></div>
			<p>These pages are built to answer common user queries on search engines. Input your keyword into Google Trends.
			From there, scroll down to breakout keywords and start a keyword list. Gather more keyword searches using http://answerthepublic.com/.
			<p>
			Once you have a list of 50+ keywords, create a single piece of content that provide adequate answers for all the user searches.
			This piece of content can be used to gain traction via referrals, social media, organic, and other earned media types.
			</p>
		</div>
	</div>
		<div class="carousel-cell">
			<div class="caraH">
				<h2>Reddit Traffic Leak</h2>
				<div class="line-break"></div>
				<p>There are numerous low-activity reddit subs with hundreds or thousands of subscribers.
			That means, promotional content and links will be unregulated. They'll also stick to the front page of the sub-reddits longer.
			You'll gain a consistent amount of referral traffic from these subs since users occasionally check in for new content.
			<p>
				You'll want to start by clicking the "random" link in the top navigation bar on reddit. Once it has taken you to a relevant sub with at least 1000 subscribers and little activity,
				make a relevant post featuring a link or content of your choice.
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="carousel-cell">
			<div class="caraH">
				<h2>Reverse Image Search Backlinks</h2>
				<div class="line-break"></div>
				<p>			If you spent time creating graphics or providing custom photographs requiring attribution, you can
			reverse image search for your images using Google.com or software like Image Raider.
			<p>
				Once you have a list of websites that use your images, you can verify if they have attributed back
				to you via a backlink. If not, you can send the webmaster an email for the attribution.
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>
			<div class="carousel-cell">
				<div class="caraH">
					<h2>Improve PPC ad-copy with SEO</h2>
					<div class="line-break"></div>
					<p>You can save on costs by testing PPC ad-copy through meta descriptions. In order for this to work, you'll need to have
			 established SERPs for organic searches that match your PPC bid term.
			<p>
				To begin, write your ad-copy and use it as your established SEO page's meta-description. Then, keep an eye on your CTR rates for the search term in your Google Search Console.
				If it increases, then great! You might be on to more effective ad-copy.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="carousel-cell">
				<div class="caraH">
					<h2>Use Smoke Tests to Find Opportunities</h2>
					<div class="line-break"></div>
					<p>Smoke tests are viability tests that allow entreprenuers and companies to determine the viability of a product idea before actually building it.
			<p>
				Start by creating a mock-landing page and mock-designs of the product idea. Set the pricing and use an analytics platform to measure traffic and events to the landing page.
				On the landing page, offer the product as if it were a real product. When users go to click the "purchase" button, they will be redirected to a "thank you page" that notes that
				the product is still in development, and to sign up for more updates. By putting a real price on the landing page, you can gauge how much your cost per customer acquistion will be.
				<br>**Free targeted traffic not included
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
				<div class="carousel-cell">
					<div class="caraH">
						<h2>Write Articles for Articles</h2>
						<div class="line-break"></div>
						<p> An article targeted to another article can increase your chances of getting backlinks from the article you targeted.
							<p>	Don't get carried away though. You'll only want to target articles with a lot of traction and you'll want to write 10x style.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="carousel-cell">
					<div class="caraH">
						<h2>Grow Your Team's Capabilities</h2>
						<div class="line-break"></div>
						<p>Using Carnegie Mellon's Capability Maturity Model, list core functions of your team.
			Each core function's processes will be diagnosed along the five stages of the CMCMM.
			<p>
				Share your model and diagnostics with your team and ask how they might improve a process.
				Once a process is documented, you'll automatically be in the second stage for the core process.
				<br>Be careful to truly develop good processes and take time to move up the stages.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>
					<div class="carousel-cell">
						<div class="caraH">
							<h2>Grow Your Online Presence With Locals</h2>
							<div class="line-break"></div>
							<p>Create a facebook group or meetup group for backlink partnerships.
			<p>
				These partnerships are valuable to businesses as they allow for local businesses to help one another out by providing links.
				Keep it contextual and you'll have no issues with Google penalties.
							</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="carousel-cell">
						<div class="caraH">
							<h2>Use IFTTT to Automate Content Syndication</h2>
							<div class="line-break"></div>
							<p>IFTTT is a platform that connects to apps and platforms. It allows users to create functions or "recipes" that automate certain tasks.
								<p>
				If you write content and manually post it on different mediums (LinkedIn, Medium, Tumblr, etc), then you could create a recipe on IFTTT to
				 automatically post the content for you when you set off a "trigger" (an action that begins the IFTTT "recipe").
							</p>
						</div>
					</div>
						<div class="carousel-cell">
							<div class="caraH">
								<h2>Create "Top" Articles For Backlinks</h2>
								<div class="line-break"></div>
								<p>Scout out websites that provide valuable information for users within a certain industry. Then, write an article about those websites, ranking them from 1 to 25+. Be sure to link out to the websites.
			Create a "Top XX Industry Blogs" badge, and add it to the sidebar. Next, send the website owners an email or tweet stating that they've made it on the Top X Industry Websites on your site.
								<p>
				Webmasters love being at the top, so let them know they're at the top of your list.
								</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="carousel-cell">
							<div class="caraH">
								<h2>Take Over Low-Competition KWs</h2>
								<div class="line-break"></div>
								<p>If you want to completely own the first page of a low competition keyword, then use multiple mediums to dominate.
			You'll want your main site to rank in the top 3. Then create a facebook, Google Plus, Twitter, Medium, etc pages and
			fill them up with valuable information about the keyword you're targeting.
								<p>
				Build a few backlinks to each medium and watch the rankings happen. Results may vary depending on competition.
								</p>
							</div>
						</div>
							<div class="carousel-cell">
								<div class="caraH">
									<h2>End Youtube Videos Tactically</h2>
									<div class="line-break"></div>
									<p>This tactic will take a bit of video editing. When the end of your video approaches, edit in a small box that contains the intro to another youtube video.
			Then provide a CTA that tells the user to continue with the next video by clicking on the small box. Use YouTube functionality to link this to the new video.
									<p>
				This will help hook the user to watching more of your videos and send them further along the marketing funnel.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
							<div class="carousel-cell">
								<div class="caraH">
									<h2>Collaborate and Make It Great</h2>
									<div class="line-break"></div>
									<p>Aside from the "XYZ experts talk about ABC" articles, collaborating with influencers on creating great content can work wonders for all your promotional mediums.
			Start with an overlooked but helpful topic in the niche you compete in and get with influencers to generate ideas and discussion about the topic.
			You can capture the discussion on podcast, as an article, video, etc.
									<p>
				Be sure to promote, promote, and promote. The influencers are also likely to promote it to their audience which may earn you a larger following.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
							<div class="carousel-cell">
								<div class="caraH">
									<h2>Challenge Opinion Articles</h2>
									<div class="line-break"></div>
									<p>If you see a popular and controversial article article about a topic you're an expert in and you don't agree with it, challenge it. Contact the website or medium where the article is published
			and formally ask to rebuttal the position taken with your own position. Provide an overview and points which you'd like to challenge.
			<p>
				If the publisher allows it, provide your rebuttal and positon in a friendly but firm manner. You could also publish it on your own website or medium.
				"Challenge" posts are usually welcomed and embraced if you keep the tone professional and friendly. With this, collaborate with the writer of the original controversial article and promote to amplify your reach.
