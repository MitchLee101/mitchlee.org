      <div class="line-break"></div>
      <p>
        I create and execute marketing strategies that help businesses grow. What's my secret weapon?
				A problem/policy/action approach to creating marketing strategies and a playbook of 150+ tactics tested over 5+ years throughout my SEO and marketing career.
				I have worked with Tulsa Community College, US NEWS University Connection, Bisk Education and managed marketing for a handful of regional and national eCommerce businesses.
				With these employers and clients, I work in every stage of marketing from viability testing, STP, competitive analysis, and 4Ps to execution.
				What are the results? These businesses have grown up to 80% in web traffic and up to 50% in acquired leads.

				Want to know more about the strategies and tactics I used to hit these numbers?

<div class="tactics">

		<div class="content">
    Commonly seen with review or "best" search queries, users occasionally search for terms mentioning specific years.
		The user may be researching product versions for current or previous years or looking to compare models.
		Regardless, data aggregators and Google show that many "keyword + year" queries have significant search volume.
		<p>
			To capitalize on these queries, content could be produced to optimize for users and search engines.

		<h2 class="thead">Mega Resource Pages</h2>
		<div class="content">
			These pages are built to answer common user queries on search engines. Input your keyword into Google Trends.
			From there, scroll down to breakout keywords and start a keyword list. Gather more keyword searches using http://answerthepublic.com/.
			<p>
			Once you have a list of 50+ keywords, create a single piece of content that provide adequate answers for all the user searches.
			This piece of content can be used to gain traction via referrals, social media, organic, and other earned media types.

		<span class="close" href="#_">&times;</span>
		<h2 class="thead">Reddit Traffic Leak</h2>
		<div class="content">
			There are numerous low-activity reddit subs with hundreds or thousands of subscribers.
			That means, promotional content and links will be unregulated. They'll also stick to the front page of the sub-reddits longer.
			You'll gain a consistent amount of referral traffic from these subs since users occasionally check in for new content.
			<p>
				You'll want to start by clicking the "random" link in the top navigation bar on reddit. Once it has taken you to a relevant sub with at least 1000 subscribers and little activity,
				make a relevant post featuring a link or content of your choice.

		<div class="content">
			If you spent time creating graphics or providing custom photographs requiring attribution, you can
			reverse image search for your images using Google.com or software like Image Raider.
			<p>
				Once you have a list of websites that use your images, you can verify if they have attributed back
				to you via a backlink. If not, you can send the webmaster an email for the attribution.

		<h2 class="thead">Improve PPC ad-copy with SEO</h2>
		<div class="content">
			You can save on costs by testing PPC ad-copy through meta descriptions. In order for this to work, you'll need to have
			 established SERPs for organic searches that match your PPC bid term.
			<p>
				To begin, write your ad-copy and use it as your established SEO page's meta-description. Then, keep an eye on your CTR rates for the search term in your Google Search Console.
				If it increases, then great! You might be on to more effective ad-copy.

		<div class="content">
			Smoke tests are viability tests that allow entreprenuers and companies to determine the viability of a product idea before actually building it.
			<p>
				Start by creating a mock-landing page and mock-designs of the product idea. Set the pricing and use an analytics platform to measure traffic and events to the landing page.
				On the landing page, offer the product as if it were a real product. When users go to click the "purchase" button, they will be redirected to a "thank you page" that notes that
				the product is still in development, and to sign up for more updates. By putting a real price on the landing page, you can gauge how much your cost per customer acquistion will be.
